        <p><strong>Personality:</strong> Mugman is cheerful, cautious, and a bit more level-headed than his brother Cuphead. He is often portrayed as the more anxious and responsible of the duo.
		He's basically Luigi from Mario Bros but without a glorious mustache!</p>
        <p><strong>Appearance:</strong> Mugman has a blue-and-white color scheme, with a large cup for a head, a short straw, a round nose, and kind of looks like he would be called "Blue Santa" by people at school.</p>
        <p><strong>Abilities:</strong> Just like Cuphead, Mugman can shoot projectiles and use various super moves. In multiplayer mode, he serves as the second player, but because of how much the
		community loved him, Studio MDHR decided to allow you to be Mugman in single player! </p>
        <p><strong>Role in Cuphead:</strong> He joins Cuphead on an adventure to repay their debt to The Devil after losing a bet at the Devil's casino.</p>
