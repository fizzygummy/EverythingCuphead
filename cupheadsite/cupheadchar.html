        <p><strong>Personality:</strong> Cuphead is adventurous, impulsive, and thrill-seeking. Unlike his cautious brother, he is reckless and often jumps into danger without thinking.</p>
        <p><strong>Appearance:</strong> Cuphead has a red-and-white color scheme, with a large cup for a head, a short straw, and looks like he'd be called <br>
			"Rudolph The Red Nose Reindeer".</p>
        <p><strong>Abilities:</strong> Just like Mugman, Cuphead can shoot projectiles and use various super moves. He is the primary playable character in single-player<br>
			mode.
        <p><strong>Role in Cuphead:</strong> Cuphead is the one who makes the fateful bet with The Devil, setting the events of the game into motion. Alongside Mugman, he fights to reclaim their souls.<br>
			Are you really the older brother??</p>
